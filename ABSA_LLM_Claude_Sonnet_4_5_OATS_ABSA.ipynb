        "This notebook implements a **Claude-Sonnet 4.5** based LLM capable of performing aspect-based sentiment analysis on the [OATS-ABSA dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jordiclive/OATS-ABSA). Instructions/explanations for testing/reviewing each code block will be outlined for posterity purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "> To recap, the previous **[T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/t5) (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)** model implemented followed a standard machine learning pipeline of:\n",
        "> 1.   Load base T5-small model\n",
        "  2.   Fine tune on labelled, preprocessed data\n",
        "  3.   Generate predictions after training\n",
        "\n",
        "Observations on the output results of the previous T5 implementation indicate that aspect extraction, sentiment classification **and** most notably aspect-to-sentiment mapping for T5 is incredibly fragile. T5 has been observed to:\n",
        "*   Fail to extract multiple aspects within a sentence\n",
        "*   Perform incomplete extraction of sentiments\n",
        "*   Hallucinate/misspell aspects\n",
        "*   Fail to identify implicit aspects\n",
        "*   Fail to correctly match sentiment to aspect\n",
        "*   Fail to extract aspects due to formatting issues\n",
        "*   Output minor formatting errors lowering F1 calculation\n",
        "\n",
        "With Sonnet 4.5, we aim to make use of its massive pre-trained corpora to perform aspect extraction, sentiment classification and mapping, all while eliminating the need for training. For this implementation, we focus on zero-shot/few-shot prompting to perform ABSA.\n",
