The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfasts were excellent and we ate a nice dinner one night in their restaurant when we were too tired to go back out. The bathroom was huge and the price was reasonable--nice contrasts with Barcelona. The room itself was adequate. There are lots of great restaurants and tapas bars in Madrid but be sure to try La Casa del Abuelo (Near Puerto del Sol) for shrimp with garlic.",

Breakfast was about average for a hotel like this. The free shuttle to Frankfurt Airport runs 24 hrs a day and takes less than 10 minutes, making it easy to get on the S-Bahn to go to either downtown Mainz or Frankfurt or a variety of other locations. This is definitly a good value for an airport hotel. It's not as convienient as a hotel that is actually in the airport, but the location off site makes it nice and quiet - the rooms are extremely well insulated.",

The room was at the back corner of the building, very spacious, and the state of the bathroom impressed me. Yes, it may not look like your average 4 star hotel, but the staff were friendly and helpful, and the location was perfect!! Makes it very easy for me to walk out to the Dam Square at mid-night just to take pictures of the snow!I would definetly stay there again when I return to Amsterdam.",

The rooms are of a reasonable size with standard tv, radio, telephone, fan, safe, trouser press and tea and coffee making facilites. I stayed for 4 nights and am pleased to report that the room was cleaned every day and fresh towels were also provided daily. The hotel had an impressive large 24 hour reception area, lounge, restaurant and bar, all appeared to be recently renovated/decorated.

We have stayed at numerous properties throughout the city and was pleasantly suprised at this hotel. From the moment we checked in, the staff was very accomodating and nice. We were upgraded and the room was very impressive. We will be staying at this hotel in the near future and want to pass on this experience to anyone looking to stay in NY.The hotel was in an excellent location and the park was my favorite spot to sit and have coffee in the mornings.",

Very well decorated rooms with little balconies to let in some fresh air (or smoke). A lot of space, blowdryers, safes in room, refrigerator in room, and plenty of soap/shampoo. Noise wasn't a problem for us and the staff was typical stiff Spanish professionalism. I was impressed with the rooms given the great location and low cost - definitely a treasure we found and can't wait to stay there again!",

I don't think any of these activities would be possible with out the excellent entertainment staff, who went out of their way to say hello, include you in the activities, and just plain make it fun.

It is right on Market Street, and is close to Chinatown. Parking is a little pricey at $40 for overnight; however, parking is at a premium at this location. We found great rates for this hotel on Expedia; however, I would recommend that you check out their website (Parc 55) first because they have several special package rates.",

I visited the concierge only to have this man rudely point me to the reception desk with this impossibly long line of people checking in. When I complained that I am already a guest, he glared at me and spat out What do you want me to do?!. HORRIBLE SERVICE!",

It was a great location due to it being a bit off the beaten path from the business of the city yet close enough to walk everywhere I wanted to go. The rooms are incredibly large and for the price that we paid, we felt that we got a great bang for our buck! The comforter on the bed was really scratchy, and the front entrance to the hotel was under contstruction, but other than that, I would definitely reccomend this place to my friends and other travelers.",

Location was ok, but not central, as it was a good 15-minute walk to Dam Square and the Centraal Station. The hotel had absolutely no character whatsoever; the lobby was uninviting; and the food in both the breakfast and the bar restaurants was only just ok. The room was a good size, and the furnishings looked relatively new and comfortable, but there was a strong drainage smell in the bathroom all the time, and there was a fizzing electrical sound all through the night, which only went away when it was drowned out by the loud air con. When I mentioned this to the reception staff at check-out, they weren't interested and didn't even comment. Only go if you get a very cheap rate as you can get this sort of mediocrity anywhere.",

I say this as I have tried some where the bean is like eating bark or some have so much chocolate covering them you can barely find the bean so you feel sick before you get the desired pick me up from the caffeine , so this is a refreshing change as the bean to choco ratio is perfect . . These are pretty spendy but in the long run well worth it since you only need a couple beans to perk you up vs the other brands that are out there . . will be buying again : )",

I tried the Nutiva hemp seeds once and like them enough that I see no reason to try another brand and Amazon has the best price of the places I compared . One serving is 3 tablespoons which is quite a lot , so keep that in mind when figuring cost per serving and when comparing various high Omega 3 products . We use them sprinkled on top of salads or cooked veggies or sometimes I put them in my VitaMix machine along with extra firm tofu to blend them into a smooth paste as the base for a huge mixed fruit breakfast milkshake / smoothie . They are a very good way to add not only Omega 3 ' s but extra protein to a meal and although the taste is very mild , they are quite good .

The numerous spices are a unique taste sensation , and enjoyable cup of tea . I brewed the tea as I always do , leaving the tea bag in far beyond the 3 - 5 minutes recommended brewing time , and the tea never turned bitter , just got stronger and tastier ! Tastes exactly like the caffeinated version , but you can drink cup after cup because there is no caffeine !",

A clear , practical and well presented overview of the digital marketing field , with an emphasis on the equal playing field : Kevin makes an effort to provide free resources and tools so that any marketer may use the power of digital analytics unhampered by resource limitations . Which is a good thing because marketers often work with budget constraints . Convincing companies to invest more in marketing , which can be a long term strategy , may not always be easy . The course covers basic concepts , ethics , history as well as practical methods . A very useful addition to my marketing knowledge base , and toolbox .",

I thought the video lectures were a little sparse . There were only 20 - 30 minutes worth of video lectures per week and the assignments required you to stretch the knowledge that you gained from the lecture videos quite a bit . More examples in video lectures would have helped . I would have also liked to see a few simple problems in each assignments just to get comfortable using the various functions introduced in the lecture . So overall , the course was challenging and definitely a fair amount of work coming from someone new to python ( but moderately experienced in C programming ) , and although I would have liked a bit more guidance , I learned a lot .",

The Course could have more focused on IoT specific scenarios compared to Generic Software Architecture . What i recommend is to change the course title and have a separate one for IoT specific matters . If the presenters can provide more practical examples that will help remember how and where we can apply these scenarios . Overall this course content is good and interesting to watch .",

While this makes it an excellent introductory course in Machine Learning and at the same time still applicable there are a few drawbacks . Your actual understanding of ML will be pretty shallow . Programming examples do to a certain extent facilitate understanding of the algorithms in use , but it ' s somewhat hard translating to real world use due to fairly heavy amount of abstraction and \" code - hiding \" . Still , I would recommend this course as a starter course for ML as it will greatly enhance your understanding for ML in general and where to go next .",

I had every field in the new parcels layer but only got 4 points . I think it was a mistake from the grader . absolutely brilliant ! This course is very well structured and very well presented . It touches upon a rather complex area of research but has masterly conveyed the essential skills and methods in a pace that is a bit challenging but not to a point of intimidating . I have watched each and every lecture video for at least 4 times . It is a very good starting point for anyone interested in FSI .",
